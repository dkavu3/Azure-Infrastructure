# Azure-Infrastructure
This project documents my Azure networking lab, featuring two peered virtual networks and a site-to-site VPN connection to an on-premises environment. It includes configuration of VMs, NSGs, and user-defined routes to enable full connectivity and serve as documentation of my learning with Azure infrastructure design.
